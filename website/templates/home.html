                <p>I imagine the person reading this is likely a recruiter or hiring manager, and if so, this message is for you.</p>
                <p>This website is an ongoing project that helps me learn many things, such as how to connect a site to the internet, how to set up a reverse proxy, and how to properly configure an SSL certificate for HTTPS.</p>
                <p>I started this project because I needed something to stand out a little bit. However, sites like Hostinger and WordPress were (1) expensive for someone who is currently in-between jobs, and (2) not teaching me anything. I would get this unsatisfying feeling (for lack of a better term).</p>
                <p>I am not trying to be a web developer; this is all just a learning process. With that being said...</p>
                <p>Hello, my name is David. I'm an aspiring cybersecurity practitioner trying to make my debut into the field of Information Technology. I intend to utilize the soft skills I obtained from years of being a server and bartender in the food industry and apply them to the customer service-based position I am currently seeking.</p>
                <p>With no prior work experience in IT, my aim is to secure a help desk position and I believe my customer service skills along with the CompTIA A+ Certification will do just that.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, to get some personal experience, I conduct homelabs and analyze the traffic on my home network using tools like Wireshark and TCPdump. I set up this web server using Flask on a Raspberry Pi. I'm using Nginx as a reverse proxy and also running a Pi-hole server for ad blocking. <i>If you're interested in the source code, feel free to check out my GitHub repository.</i></p>
                <p>It's been almost two years since I decided to make a career change into the Information Technology field and I'm proud of how far I've come without any formal education in IT or Computer Science. However, I am aware of the disadvantages of not having a formal education. I  sometimes lack guidence or a sense of direction but I do have a goal, and thats to find a Help Desk position as soon as possible.</p>
                
                <p>Key skills that I'm improving as I continue to build this site are, Attention to detail, </p>
                <p></p>
