                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm an aspiring cybersecurity practitioner trying to make my debut into the of Information Technology. 
                        I intend to utilize the soft skills I obtained from years of being a server and bartender in the Service Industry 
                        and apply them to the customer service-based position I am currently seeking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the IT experience I gained working at Konica Minolta, I aim to secure an entry level help desk position 
                        and finally begin my career in IT. I believe my customer service skills, along with the CompTIA A+ Certification, 
                        will help me achieve this goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime, to gain personal experience, I conduct homelabs to analyze the traffic on my home network using 
                        tools like Wireshark and TCPdump. I set up this web server using Flask and Gunicorn on a Raspberry Pi. I'm using 
                        Nginx as a reverse proxy and also running a Pi-hole server for ad blocking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's been almost two years since I decided to make a career change into the Information Technology field, and I'm 
                        proud of how far I've come. I still remember trying to understand for the first time what an IDE (Integrated 
                        Development Environment) is. However, I am aware of the disadvantages of not having a formal education. For one, 
                        I sometimes lack guidance or a sense of direction, after all, There's so much to learn in Information Technology.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The knowledge is free..</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong> Harvard University puts their ENTIRE 2023 CS50 course on YouTube for FREE? 
                        You mean I don't have to pay $50,000 for a degree? That's when it hit me. I realized the degree is $50,000, 
                        and the knowledge is what's free.
                        From that point, I became increasingly interested in everything thats Computer Science. I then focused on building my workstation at home,
                        to a complete home office setup with 3 monitors and 2 MFDs to maxamize productivity. At the same time, I was studying for the CompTIA A+ Certification 
                        because I figured I had to start somewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My years in the Service Industry have taught me great customer service, communication, and conflict resolution skills. 
                        I always try to remain humble and ready to learn. I work well with others, but I flourish when I work alone. 
                        I'm adaptable, resilient, and patient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I pride myself on my work ethic. I am loyal to a fault. I'm looking for longevity and for a company that I can 
                        provide value to, and in return, I can become part of the community. I am not looking for a job; I'm looking for a career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a believer in the formula: <strong>Luck = Preparation + Opportunity</strong>, and <strong>Value = Time + Focus (Energy)</strong>. 
                        I remember these formulas when I find myself distracted. They remind me of my goals and help me get back on track.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started this web server about a month ago. You can check out the code in my
