                <p>TLDR: a nerd.</p>           
                <p>I'm an aspiring cybersecurity practitioner trying to make my debut into the field of Information Technology. I intend to utilize the soft skills I obtained from years of being a server and bartender in the Service Industry and apply them to the customer service-based position I am currently seeking.</p>
                <p>With no prior work experience in IT, aside from my job at Konica Minolta, I aim to secure a help desk position and finally begin my career in IT and I believe my customer service skills along with the CompTIA A+ Certification will do just that.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, to get some personal experience, I conduct homelabs to analyze the traffic on my home network using tools like Wireshark and TCPdump. I set up this web server using Flask and gunicorn on a Raspberry Pi. I'm using Nginx as a reverse proxy and also running a Pi-hole server for ad blocking.</p>
                <p>It's been almost two years since I decided to make a career change into the Information Technology field and I'm proud of how far I've come, given I can still remember trying to understand for the first time what an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) is. However, I am aware of the disadvantages of not having a formal education. For one, I sometimes lack guidence or a sense of direction, but I do have a goal, and thats to find a Help Desk position as soon as possible.</p>
                
                <h1>Things My Resume Wont Tell You</h1>
                <p>DID YOU KNOW? Harvard University puts their ENTIRE 2023 CS50 course on YouTube for FREE? You mean I dont have to pay $50,000 for a Degree? That's when it hit me. I realized the degree is $50,000 but the knowledge is free. MIND = BLOWN
                From that point I sort've been obsessed with programming. Later that year I decided I'll need the A+ Certification since I dont have any prior experience, I figured its best I get a vocational certificate as proof I have an understanding of the basic fundamentals.</p>
                <p>My years of being in the Service Industry has taught me great customer service, communication and conflict resolution skills.
                I always try to remain humble and ready-to-learn. I work well with others but I flourish when I work alone. I'm adaptable, resilient, and patient.</p>
                <p>I pride myself in my work ethic. I am loyal to a fault. I'm looking for longevity and for a company that I can provide value to and in return, I can become part of the community. I am not looking for a job, I'm looking for a career.</p>
                <p>I'm believer of Luck = Preparation + Opportunity, Value = Time + Focus(Energy). I remember these fomulas when I find myself distracted, it reminds me of my goals and helps me get back on track. </p>
                <p>I started this webserver almost about a month ago, you can check out the code in my github repository.</p>
